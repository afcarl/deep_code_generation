`python -m tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.utils.inspect_checkpoint`

## Useful Links:
* [Intro to training recurrent nets on text](http://ml4a.github.io/guides/recurrent_neural_networks/). Very simple into, basis on how first experiments were carried out.
* [Similar to above, simplified lstm training](http://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/)

Experiment:
use min for kl loss term (look up a good value)
